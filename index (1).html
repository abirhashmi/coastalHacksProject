<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines being healthy as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”</p>
<h2>How You Can Improve Your Health!</h2>
<li>Sleep 8 hours</li> 
<p>Sleep allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. Furthermore sleep also helps the body remain healthy and fight off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly.</p>
<li>Stay active</li>
<p>Staying active has both mental and physical benifits. It helps relieve stress and clear your mind. Staying active also improves your fitness thus helping you manage health conditions and stay out of the hospital.</p>
<li>Find purpose and meaning</li>
<p>Finding purpose and meaning allows you to feel productive and useful. This is very benifical for one's mental health as it distracts them from negative thoughts.</p>
